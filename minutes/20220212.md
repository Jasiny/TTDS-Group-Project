# TTDS Group Meeting 5

**Duration**: 2022-2-12 13:00-16:00

**Secretary**: Hongyan Deng


**Unresolved Questions for Datasets**:

- Datasets not enough: lack of word and definition pairs

- Datasets definitions are too authoritative: might perform bad on user inputs who are not  experts of linguistics


**Potential Solutions for Data Augment**:

- Add data categorized by topics: identify which topics the query belongs to, and search its relative topic datasets

- Add Wiki abstracts

- Synonym substitution: subtitute some low frequency words to semantically equivalent high frequency words

- Reconstruct datasets: remove repeat word-definition pairs 

- Develop exclusive stopword list: delete some English stopwords in nltk, and only remain necessary words e.g. a, the, can etc.

- Preprocess definitions: stem definitions after removing stop words 


**To-Do List**:

- Data augment and dataset reconstruction

- Attempt varients of TF-IDF e.g. BM25

- Fine-tune BERT: obtain the transformations of sentence embedding, which maximizes the similarity between definition and word pairs
