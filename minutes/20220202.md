# TTDS Group Meeting 4

**Duration**: 2022-2-02 14:00-16:00

**Secretary**: Haochen Qin

**Content**:

- Work plan: develop basic algorithm and environment code before start of March

- Basic algorithm including TFIDF+cluster and network-based models

- Optimization including data augmentation (adding synset to document dataset), optimizing KNN algorithm such as approximate nearest neighbors, utilizing negative-sampling mechanism

- Paper Review: Learning to Understand Phrases by Embedding the Dictionary (reverse dictionary)

**To-Do List**:

- Refine basic model pipeline as baseline

- Implement network-based models

- Get familiar about data augmentation methods in NLP, including potential bias between native and non-native speaker when defining a word, constructing new queries by replacing words in dataset, cross translation (once or multiple times), word definition from human

- Optimizing TDIDF representation by SVD

**Unresolved Questions**:

- Efficacy of data augmentation methods, efficacy of optimized methods for basic models

- Result filter methods: based on use selection or POS tag given by dependency parse
